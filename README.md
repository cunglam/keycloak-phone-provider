 + Phone support like e-mail
 + One Time Password (OTP) by phone
 + Login by phone
 + Register with phone
 + Authentication by phone
 + Reset password by phone
 + WeiXin APP Grant

sms
voice
phone one key login

With this provider you can **enforce authentication policies based on a verification token sent to users' mobile phones**.
Currently, there are implementations for:

+ Aliyun
+ AWS SNS
+ Cloopen
+ Tencent
+ TotalVoice
+ Twilio,
+ YunTongXun SMS
+ Bulk SMS
+ Two Factor

More services can be added with ease due to the modularity of the code.  In fact, nothing would stop you from implementing a
sender of TTS calls or WhatsApp messages.

This is what you can do for now:
  + Check ownership of a phone number (Forms and Rest API)
  + Use SMS as second factor in 2FA method (Browser flow)
  + Login by phone (Browser flow)
  + Reset Password by phone
  + Authentication by phone (Rest API)
  + Authenticate everybody by phone, auto create user on Grant (Rest API)
  + Register with phone
  + Register only phone (username is phone number)
  + Register add user attribute with `redirect_uri` params

## Compatibility

This was initially developed using Quarkus Keycloak as baseline.  Wildfily keycloak is not supported
anymore and I did not test user storage beyond Kerberos or LDAP. I may try to help you but I cannot guarantee.

## Usage

### **Installing:**

+ Docker
  1. docker image is [coopersoft/keycloak:21.0.2_phone-2.3.3](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/coopersoft/keycloak)

```shell
  kc.[sh|bat] start \
    --spi-phone-default-service=[dummy|aws|aliyun|cloopen| ...]  # Which sms provider
    --spi-phone-default-token-expires-in=60  # sms expires ,default 60 second

    --spi-phone-default-[$realm-]otp-expires=3600 #default: 60 * 60; 1 hour

    ...  # provider param refer provider`s readme.md
```

### **Theme**

You will need to change the realm login theme to `phone`.

You can create a customized theme base on `phone`.

```
  parent=phone
```

### **Phone registration support**

Two user attributes are going to be used by this provider: `phoneNumberVerified` (bool) and `phoneNumber` (str). Multiple
users can have the same `phoneNumber`, but only one of them will have `phoneNumberVerified` = `true` at the end of a
verification process. This accommodates the use case of pre-paid numbers that get recycled if inactive for too much time.

Under `Authentication` > `Flows`:

+ Copy the `Registration` flow to `Registration with phone` flow through the menu button on the right of the `registration` flow

+ Replace `Registration User Creation` with `Registration Phone User Creation`

+ (Optional) Click on settings for `Registration Phone User Creation` to configure it

+ (Optional) To enable phone verification, click on `Registration with phone registration Form` >`Add` `Phone validation` if you want to verify phone.

+ (Optional) Read query parameter add to user attribute:  
  Click on `Registration with phone registration Form` > `Actions` > `Add execution` on the `Query Parameter Reader` line  
  Click on `Registration with phone registration Form` > `Actions` > `configure` add accept param name in to  

+ (Optional) Hidden password field:  
  Delete or disable `Password Validation`.

+ (Optional) if not any user profile:  
  Delete or disable `Profile Validation`

Set all added items as `Required`.

On the `Authentication` page, bind `Registration with phone` to `Registration flow` and select it to be `Required`.

Under `Realm Settings` > `Themes`
Set `Login Theme` to `phone`

Tip:
  If Realm parameter `Email as username` is true, then config `Phone number as username` and `hide email` is invalid!  
  If parameter `duplicate-phone` is true then `Phone number as username` is invalid!

![Registration with phone](https://github.com/cooper-lyt/keycloak-phone-provider/raw/master/examples/document/a0.png)


Registration URL:
```
http://<domain>/realms/<realm name>/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=<client id>&response_type=code&scope=openid%20email&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
```
### **Login by phone**
Under `Authentication` > `Flows`:

![Login By phone](https://github.com/cooper-lyt/keycloak-phone-provider/raw/master/examples/document/e0.jpg)


### **2FA by Phone OTP**


 Phone OTP uses OTP Credential's phone number,Different from the user's phone number, Credential's phone number come from required actions `Configure OTP over SMS`, Unless the `Create OTP Credential` is enabled on user registration flow.


  On Authentication page, copy the browser flow and replace `OTP` with  `OTP Over SMS` . Don't forget to bind this flow copy as the de facto browser flow.
  Finally, Enable the required actions `Configure OTP over SMS` in the Required Actions tab.

**About the API endpoints:**

You'll get 2 extra endpoints that are useful to do the verification from a custom application.

+ `GET /realms/{realmName}/sms/verification-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234` (To request a number verification. No auth required.)
+ `POST /realms/{realmName}/sms/verification-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234&code=123456` (To verify the process. User must be authenticated.)

You'll get 2 extra endpoints that are useful to do the access token from a custom application.
+ `GET /realms/{realmName}/sms/authentication-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234` (To request a number verification. No auth required.)
+ `POST /realms/{realmName}/protocol/openid-connect/token`
  `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  `grant_type=password&phone_number=$PHONE_NUMBER&code=$VERIFICATION_CODE&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRECT`

  Testing , coming soon!


## Thanks
Some code written is based on existing ones in these two projects: [keycloak-sms-provider](https://github.com/mths0x5f/keycloak-sms-provider)
and [keycloak-phone-authenticator](https://github.com/FX-HAO/keycloak-phone-authenticator). Certainly I would have many problems
coding all those providers blindly. Thank you!
